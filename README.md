This repository provides the R routines used in the article [Reducing Inequalities Using an Unbiased Machine Learning Approach to Identify Births with the Highest Risk of Preventable Neonatal Deaths](). It is a joint work with Antonio [Pedro Ramos](https://tomramos.github.io/), Fabio Calieraro, and [Raphael Saldanha](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/), published in _Population Health Metrics_.

The paper proposes a data-driven approach that combines several risk factors and provides digested information that identifies which neonates are at the highest risk of preventable death. By utilizing administrative databases from the Brazilian health ministry, we train machine-learning algorithms, test their performance on unseen data, and evaluate them using a new policy-oriented metric that computes the proportion of deaths captured by setting the threshold levels of the highest predicted mortality risk. The results suggest that high proportions of neonatal deaths are captured with low threshold levels. In addition, it is investigated how the most vulnerable groups would be impacted by a targeting policy based on this metric, and the findings indicate that these groups wouldn't be disadvantaged.
